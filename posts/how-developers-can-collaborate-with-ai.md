# How Developers Can Collaborate with AI

Imagine having a coding partner who never sleeps, constantly scans through documentation, and suggests improvements in real time. AI tools are rapidly becoming that partner for developers around the globe. But to truly harness this power, it’s not enough to simply prompt an AI and paste its output—successful collaboration requires strategy, nuance, and critical thinking.

## 1. Know What AI Does Best (and Where It Falls Short)

AI excels at:
- Generating boilerplate code (CRUD endpoints, component scaffolds).
- Rapidly exploring alternatives (refactoring suggestions, naming ideas).
- Summarizing large codebases or documentation.

However, AI can:
- Introduce subtle bugs or outdated patterns.
- Miss business context or edge cases.
- Struggle with deeply domain-specific logic.

## 2. Craft Clear, Context-Rich Prompts

The better your prompt, the more reliable the result. Include:
- **Your goal**: “Create a GraphQL resolver that ...”
- **Context**: small snippets of existing code or folder structure.
- **Constraints**: coding style, supported frameworks, performance needs.

Example prompt:

```text
I'm using Express.js with TypeScript. Can you generate a POST route `/api/users` that:
- Validates `name` and `email` in the request body.
- Returns JSON with a 201 status code on success.
- Sends a 400 error if validation fails.
```

## 3. Treat AI as an Iterative Partner

- **Review and ask follow-ups**: If the initial code doesn't handle an edge case, ask “Can you add validation for phone numbers?”
- **Combine approaches**: Merge AI suggestions with your preferred libraries or utilities.
- **Refine progressively**: Break large tasks into smaller prompts.

## 4. Test, Validate, and Refactor

1. Write unit and integration tests for generated code.
2. Run benchmarks if performance matters.
3. Refactor for readability and consistency with your style guide.
4. Document any AI-driven decisions for future reference.

## 5. Build an AI-Savvy Team Culture

- Share prompt libraries for common tasks (error handling, authentication).
- Host brown-bag sessions demoing AI best practices.
- Establish guidelines for ethical and secure AI use.

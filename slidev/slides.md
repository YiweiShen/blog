# Business Model Canvas Explained

## Agenda
- Purpose of the canvas
- The nine building blocks
- How to fill it in
- Facilitation tips
- Example prompts and next steps

---

# Why Use the Canvas?

> A one-page, visual summary of how a business creates, delivers, and captures value.

1. Align teams on a shared model quickly
2. Spot risks and assumptions early
3. Compare ideas side-by-side
4. Turn strategy into concrete experiments

---

# The Nine Building Blocks

1. **Value Proposition** - the job-to-be-done you solve  
2. **Customer Segments** - for whom you create value  
3. **Channels** - how you reach and deliver  
4. **Customer Relationships** - how you acquire, retain, grow  
5. **Revenue Streams** - how money comes in  
6. **Key Resources** - critical assets you need  
7. **Key Activities** - the work you must excel at  
8. **Key Partnerships** - outside help and leverage  
9. **Cost Structure** - major fixed and variable costs

---

# Value Proposition

> The core benefit or outcome you deliver.

- What pain do you remove or gain do you create?
- How is this better than existing options?
- What proof shows this matters (data, testimonials)?

---

# Customer Segments

> The distinct groups you serve.

- Primary users vs. buyers?
- Early adopters vs. later majority?
- What jobs, pains, and contexts differ by segment?

---

# Channels

> How you reach customers and deliver value.

- Awareness: ads, content, events
- Evaluation: demos, trials, sales calls
- Delivery: app, retail, partners, support

---

# Customer Relationships

> How you manage the lifecycle.

- Onboarding: self-serve vs. high-touch
- Retention: nurture, community, support, SLAs
- Expansion: cross-sell, upsell, referrals

---

# Revenue Streams

> How the business captures value.

- Pricing: one-time, subscription, usage, tiered
- Unit economics: ARPU, LTV, margin assumptions
- Ancillary: services, ads, marketplace fees

---

# Key Resources

> The assets you rely on.

- Team skills, IP, brand, data, tech stack
- Physical assets or distribution rights
- Which are scarce, defensible, or bottlenecks?

---

# Key Activities

> What you must do exceptionally well.

- Build and ship product? Acquire supply? Run operations?
- Metrics that prove excellence (activation, uptime, quality)

---

# Key Partnerships

> External parties that lower risk or increase leverage.

- Strategic alliances, suppliers, distributors
- Platform dependencies, integrations, regulators
- What happens if a partner fails?

---

# Cost Structure

> The major costs to run the model.

- Fixed vs. variable; people vs. infrastructure vs. acquisition
- Which costs scale with growth? Which are step-changes?
- Do costs align with the chosen revenue model?

---

# How to Fill the Canvas

1. Start with **Value Proposition** and **Customer Segments**
2. Map **Channels** and **Customer Relationships**
3. Add **Revenue Streams** and **Cost Structure** to stress-test viability
4. Close with **Key Resources**, **Activities**, **Partnerships**
5. Mark assumptions vs. facts; turn assumptions into experiments

---

# Facilitation Tips

- Time-box each block (5-10 minutes) to keep flow
- Use sticky notes: one idea per note; cluster duplicates
- Push for specifics: numbers, sources, owners
- End with top three risks and next validation steps

---

# Example Prompts for Teams

- "Describe our top two customer segments and their key pains."
- "List three channels to reach Segment A with rough CAC estimates."
- "What evidence do we have that this value proposition matters?"
- "What assumptions must be true for our revenue model to work?"

---

# Next Steps

- Turn highest-risk assumptions into experiments (interviews, landing pages, pilots)
- Build a lightweight metrics dashboard: activation, retention, CAC, LTV
- Revisit the canvas after each experiment to reflect learning
